# Paft.Ie - a project by Dessie, Llian and Zezam

Before we push anything to this project, we should first decide on a branch structure. Gitflow is pretty outdated at this point but it'll do for our project. Read about it here:

## Todos
- Set up the database DONE
- Implement CRUD IN PROGRESS
- Implement user authentication IN PROGRESS


## Current tasks
Llian - Create database, dump file DONE, enable search functionality IN PROGRESS

Zezam - Create website layout, CSS IN PROGRESS

Dessie - Connect database to webpage IN PROGRESS

## Current goals
- Replace the placeholder HTML with Zezam's polished layout
- Enable login at Admin level
- Cascade privileges to all levels below 

## Future goals
I think we should first create the Admin level as the admin has the most privileges. After that we'll simply create the landlord and tenant levels by removing certain privileges
