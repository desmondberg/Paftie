# Paft.Ie - a project by Dessie, Llian and Zezam

Before we push anything to this project, we should first decide on a branch structure. Gitflow is pretty outdated at this point but it'll do for our project. Read about it here:

## Todos
- Set up the database
- Implement CRUD
- Implement user authentication


## Current tasks
Llian - Create database, dump file
Zezam - Create website layout, CSS
Dessie - Connect database to webpage

## Current goals
Create a basic version of the page that's only on the public level. Fill the database with a couple manually-entered properties and users so we can display them. Once we get all of that working we can start working on the user authentification. 

## Future goals
I think we should first create the Admin level as the admin has the most privileges. After that we'll simply create the landlord and tenant levels by removing certain privileges
